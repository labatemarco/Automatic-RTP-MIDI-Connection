This python script's purpose is ultimately to, on startup, automatically open audio midi setup and connect rtp network connections for the user,
which is normally a manual process. (WIP) - it is still needing ability to select multiple rtp connections as opposed to just one and also needs 
to be converted to an App for startup on OSX.

NOTE: For this script to function, spotlight search must be enabled as the keyboard shortcut "command + space"
